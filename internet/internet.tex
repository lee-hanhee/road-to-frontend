\section{How Does the Internet Work?}
\begin{definition}
    The Internet works through a global network of interconnected computers and servers, communicating via standardized protocols. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data is broken into packets and routed through various network nodes using the Internet Protocol (IP). 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item These packets travel across different physical infrastructures.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable delivery and reassembly of packets at their destination. 
        \item Domain Name System (DNS) servers translate human-readable website names into IP addresses. 
        \item When you access a website, your device sends a request to the appropriate server, which responds with the requested data. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This process enables the seamless exchange of information across vast distances.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
